# DiscordBot
My [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that runs on the server my friends and I run.

The bot is written in NodeJS and runs on a Raspberry Pi on my home network (*it's sick set up, I know*).

This is a pet project. I don't get paid to maintain this.

## Dependencies
- `discordjs`
- `nodemon`
- `discordpaginationembed`

## Features

  - Add/remove commands on the fly
- Administrator commands

- Identification system for newcomers
- Daily "Word" of the Day (which is generated by a trained AI)
  - The words are not intended to be real, but sometimes they are.

  - Achieved with regex (*which was very necessary*... not)
