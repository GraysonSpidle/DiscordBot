# DiscordBot
My [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that runs on the server my friends and I run.

The bot is written in NodeJS and runs on a Raspberry Pi on my home network (*it's sick set up, I know*).

This is a pet project. I don't get paid to maintain this.

## Dependencies
#### Node Modules
- `discordjs`: for interacting with the Discord API
- `nodemon`: soley to restart the bot
- `discord-paginationembed`: for the help menus
- `cluster`: for the multithreading
- `random-number-csprng`: rng duh
#### Linux Packages Used
- `tmux`: so I can ssh into the pi and start the bot without having to have the window open 24/7

## Features
